# Dijkstra's Algorithm in Pathfinding: Navigation System Implementation

## Goal: Implement a graph using:
- [1] Adjacency List
- [2] Adjacency Matrix

## Mark Breakdown:
- [1] (30 Marks): Parse and Prompt
- [2] (30 Marks): Create Data Structure and Implement Dijkstra
- [3] (20 Marks): Process source-destination pair for both implmentations & print time taken. Express which implmentation is better in terms of time complexity.
- [4] (10 Marks): Testing and Validation
- [5] (10 Marks): Follow submission guidelines

## HOW TO RUN
You can either use 'make' to compile the project or run it in vscode or some other cpp IDE.
The output prompts you and provides the relative file paths as well as the key type for ease.
You will then be prompted for 2 keys to dijktra
