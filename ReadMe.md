# Dijkstra's Algorithm in Pathfinding: Navigation System Implementation

## Goal: Implement a graph using:
- [1] Adjacency List
- [2] Adjacency Matrix

## Mark Breakdown:
- [1] (30 Marks): Parse and Prompt
- [2] (30 Marks): Create Data Structure and Implement Dijkstra
- [3] (20 Marks): Process source-destination pair for both implmentations & print time taken. Express which implmentation is better in terms of time complexity.
- [4] (10 Marks): Testing and Validation
- [5] (10 Marks): Follow submission guidelines
